        "(20 points). You are required to build a **regression** model to predict the house price with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes. The purpose of this question is to practice regression analysis, an supervised learning model. The training data, testing data, and data description files can be download from canvas. Here is an axample for implementation: https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-in-python-predict-the-bay-areas-home-price-5c91c8378878.\n",

        "2. Based on the EDA results, select a number of features for the regression model. Shortly explain why you select those features.\n",
        "3. Develop a regression model. The train set should be used.\n",
        "4. Evaluate performance of the regression model you developed using appropriate evaluation metrics. The test set should be used."
