        "K-means Clustering: K-means clustering is a centroid-based algorithm that works well when the data has clearly defined, spherical clusters. It aims to minimize within-cluster variance by partitioning data points into k clusters based on their feature similarity. The main limitation of K-means is that it assumes clusters are isotropic and of roughly equal size, which makes it less effective for datasets with irregular or non-convex shapes. Additionally, K-means requires the number of clusters, k, to be predefined, which can be a challenge if the optimal k is not known in advance. The algorithm’s performance can be heavily influenced by the initial choice of centroids, often resulting in local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that works by grouping together points that are closely packed and marking points in low-density regions as outliers. Unlike K-means, DBSCAN does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, and it is particularly effective for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes. However, DBSCAN's performance is sensitive to the choice of the parameters eps (radius of neighborhood) and min_samples (minimum number of points required to form a cluster). It can struggle with datasets that have varying densities or high-dimensional spaces and may assign many points to the same cluster or fail to detect meaningful clusters if the parameters are not well-chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, where clusters are nested within each other based on their similarity. This method can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), allowing for flexibility in cluster formation. Hierarchical clustering is particularly useful when there is a need to understand the nested relationships between data points. However, it is computationally expensive for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(n²), and may struggle with noise or outliers. Additionally, hierarchical clustering can be sensitive to the choice of distance metrics, which can significantly impact the resulting clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word2Vec: Word2Vec is a neural network-based approach to word embedding that represents words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. This method captures semantic relationships between words based on their context in large text corpora. In clustering applications, Word2Vec can provide a meaningful representation of text, enabling more semantic clustering of reviews or documents. However, Word2Vec has limitations, such as difficulty in handling long-range dependencies between words and requiring a large corpus of text to generate quality embeddings. Additionally, its performance depends on how well the word vectors generalize to new, unseen words or phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a pre-trained transformer-based model that captures the contextual relationships between words and phrases in text. Unlike Word2Vec, which generates static word embeddings, BERT provides context-sensitive embeddings that improve the accuracy of text clustering tasks, especially for complex, nuanced language. BERT has proven highly effective for understanding the meaning of sentences, making it ideal for tasks such as document clustering where the context of the entire sentence matters. However, BERT is computationally intensive and slower to run than other methods, requiring significant resources, especially for large datasets. Despite this, its ability to understand deep contextual meaning often results in the best performance for clustering, particularly when combined with fine-tuning on domain-specific data.\n",

        "The exercise was truly informative since it gave a wide view of various clustering techniques and how to apply them to text data. Hands-on experience with preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering kept emphasizing the importance of choosing the right algorithm for a particular problem. Each of these techniques had various merits and flaws; I received practical experience in working with text data regarding how to handle noisy unstructured data and tune models for optimum performance. The experience also brought into sharp focus the trade-offs between computational efficiency and the depth of insight afforded by more complex models such as BERT.\n",
